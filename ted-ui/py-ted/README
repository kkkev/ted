Python ted UI.

Very simple command line interface to ted.

To run make sure thrift and ted are in your PYTHONPATH, you man need to run:

$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<ted_location>ted-api/target/generated-sources/gen-py/

To use the UI run in and you'll see a prompt '>'. From here you can
type commands. 'help()' will show the list of commands supported.
They are generated directly from the thrift objects, so there is no
need to change anything when the objects change.

Before these thrift commands can be run a connection to the ted-server
is required. With the server running type the command 'connect()' to
connect to the server on the localhost. This command will later be
updated to accept a server, but for now will only connect locally.

Here is a quick example commands:

> connect()

> import ted
> t = ted.ttypes.TorrentSource()
> t.uid = 1
> t.type = "RSS"
> t.name = "test"
> t.location = "http://url.invalid"

> addTorrentSource(t)

> search("showname")

> startWatching('11111')

Currently incorrect types will crash the UI. This will be fixed in
later versions.
